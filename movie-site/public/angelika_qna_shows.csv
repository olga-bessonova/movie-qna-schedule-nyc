Angelika NYC,MEGADOC: EARLY ACCESS Q&A,https://angelikafilmcenter.com/nyc/movies/details/megadoc-early-access-qa,NR,Documentary,1 H 47 MIN,English,"A raw, fly-on-the-wall documentary about Francis Ford Coppola's decades-long journey in creating his self-financed passion project, Megalopolis. The bold and unrelenting epic returns in Mike Figgis' portrait of Coppola's creative process -- weaving together archival material, unfiltered cast interviews, and a close-up view of how the legendary filmmaker drew from Roman history, political allegory, and his own singular vision to shape the world of Megalopolis. This isn't a record of a production on the brink, it's a personal memoir unfolding in real time.
