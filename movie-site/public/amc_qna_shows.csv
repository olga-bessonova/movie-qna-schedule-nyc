AMC,Paris Hilton Infinite Icon: A Visual Memoir Live Q&A with Paris Hilton,https://www.amctheatres.com/movies/paris-hilton-infinite-icon-a-visual-memoir-live-q-a-with-paris-hilton-82461,2026-01-30,"INFINITE ICON: A VISUAL MEMOIR brings us an intimate, nuanced and candid portrait of Paris Hilton, one of the most famous figures of 21st century pop culture, and one of its most misunderstood. When Hilton first gained notice as a club kid in the late 1990s, people didn't know what to make of her. With no template for this new kind of celebrity, the paparazzi and the public wrote her off as nothing more than a spoiled party girl. The reality was more complicated: for the painfully shy Hilton, nightclubs were a refuge, a place where music provided escape, joy, acceptance and community. Directors Bruce Robertson and JJ Duncan's artfully crafted documentary follows Hilton as she returns to music in 2024 with her first-ever concert at the Hollywood Palladium and places the event in the larger context of her life as a public figure who was by turns idolized and vilified. Drawing on decades of personal archives, intimate interviews, verite documentary footage, and the concert itself, the film uncovers the ways Hilton has navigated both cultural adoration and cruelty. Infinite Icon: A Visual Memoir finds Hilton speaking her truth while exploring how music -- as inspiration, aspiration, lifeline -- became the throughline that has sustained her survival, reinvention, and resilience.",2 HR 20 MIN,PG13,https://www.amctheatres.com/movies/paris-hilton-infinite-icon-a-visual-memoir-live-q-a-with-paris-hilton-82461/showtimes,"https://amc-theatres-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_767,h_410,g_auto/f_auto/q_auto/v1689297956/content/general/ga77qsatemd65jyqzfnc.jpg",1
