After redefining rock documentaries and volume knobs, the band returns to the screen in Spinal Tap II: The End Continues. Join the attempting-to-be legendary filmmaker Marty DiBergi and the original members of Spinal Tap—David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek Smalls—for a once-in-a-lifetime live post-screening Q&A. Forty-one years after the release of the groundbreaking mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, the now estranged bandmates David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek Smalls (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer) are forced to reunite for one final concert. Spinal Tap II: The End Continues also marks the resurrection of documentarian Marty Di Bergi (Rob Reiner), who once again tries to capture his favorite metal gods as they contemplate mortality—and the hope that their 12th drummer doesn’t join them in The Great Beyond. Joined by music royalty Paul McCartney and Elton John, Spinal Tap wrestles with their checkered past to put on a concert that they hope will solidify their place in the pantheon of rock ’n' roll.",1 HR 54 MIN,R,https://www.amctheatres.com/movies/spinal-tap-ii-the-end-continues-on-off-and-around-the-record-imax-live-q-a-event-81136/showtimes,"https://amc-theatres-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_767,h_410,g_auto/f_auto/q_auto/v1755095058/amc-cdn/production/2/movies/81100/81136/MovieStillDynamic/172507.jpg"
